# MIS312 Assignment 2 — Using Copilot and Reading Code

**Book Alignment:** Chapter 2  
**Primary Goal:** Collaborate with Copilot/AI and begin reading code line-by-line  
**Environment:** JupyterLab (`.ipynb`)  
**Submission:** OneNote Artifact (PDF)

## Learning Objectives
Students will:
- Observe how AI suggests code from a clear prompt/comment
- Decide when to accept, reject, or modify AI suggestions
- Explain what each line of a simple program does

---

## Student Tasks

### Task 1 — Generate a small program with AI assistance
Create: `assignment02_copilot.ipynb`

Type ONLY this comment first:
```python
# Write a Python program that asks for a user's name and prints a greeting.
```

Use Copilot or the MIS312 AI Assistant to produce code, then run it.

### Task 2 — Improve the program
Modify it to:
- Ask for the user’s name
- Ask for the user’s favorite food (or hobby)
- Print a friendly message using both inputs

### Task 3 — Code reading
Add comments explaining what each line does (focus on `input()`, variables, and `print()`).

### Task 4 — AI improvement (required)
Ask:
> “Suggest one improvement to make my program clearer or more user-friendly for a beginner.”

Implement exactly one improvement and re-run.

## OneNote Artifact Requirements
- Screenshot showing successful output
- Code snippet with your line-by-line comments
- AI prompt + summary
- Reflection:
  - When was AI helpful?
  - What did you choose to change yourself?

## Instructor Notes
Reward judgment (not blind copying). Require at least one meaningful improvement.
