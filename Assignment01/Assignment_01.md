# MIS312 Assignment 1 — Introduction to AI-Assisted Python Programming

**Book Alignment:** Chapter 1  
**Primary Goal:** Build confidence, understand AI-assisted programming, and learn the OneNote Artifact workflow  
**Environment:** JupyterLab (`.ipynb`)  
**Submission:** OneNote Artifact (PDF)

---

## Learning Objectives
Students will:
- Explain (in plain language) what **AI-assisted programming** is and why it is used
- Run and modify a simple Python program in JupyterLab
- Practice capturing evidence (code + screenshots) in the MIS312 OneNote Artifact format

---

## Student Tasks

### Task 1 — Launch JupyterLab and create your notebook
1. Launch JupyterLab (MIS312 environment).
2. Create a new notebook named: `assignment01_intro.ipynb`

### Task 2 — Your first Python run
Run:
```python
print("Hello, MIS312!")
```

Modify it to include:
- Your first name
- One reason you are taking MIS312

Example:
```python
print("Hello, MIS312! My name is Pat and I’m taking this course to learn practical programming.")
```

### Task 3 — Variables + print (very small)
Add:
```python
course = "MIS312"
semester = "Spring 2026"
print("Course:", course)
print("Semester:", semester)
```
Change the values, re-run, and confirm you see updated output.

### Task 4 — One AI interaction (required)
Ask one AI tool:
> “Explain what this Python code does in simple beginner-friendly terms.”

---

## OneNote Artifact Requirements
- Task Summary (3–5 sentences)
- Code Evidence (your notebook cells)
- Execution Evidence (screenshot of output)
- AI Interaction (prompt + summary)
- Reflection:
  - What felt easy?
  - What felt confusing?
  - What did the AI explanation help you understand?

## Instructor Notes
Grade lightly. A strong artifact matters more than sophisticated code.
